# first we invite numpy over : import numpy
# at the same time we give numpy the nickname np : as np
import numpy as np

# here is the data we want to investigate
x = [1,3,6,2,8,4,1]

# now that numpy (np) is here we can ask them to use their mean function
x_mean = np.mean(x)
# then we ask numpy to use its standard deviation function on the data
x_standard_dev = np.std(x)

# finally we will print the result
print(x_mean)
print(x_standard_dev)
